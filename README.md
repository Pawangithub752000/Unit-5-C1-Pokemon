If you are 90's kid you know pokemon; even if you are not, you must know pokemon :p ( who doesn't )..

Here is the documentation for the same https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon​
Your evaluation is divided into two parts but you will be using the same page; divide your page into two parts;​

As soon as the page loads; Make a network request and get atleast 20 pokemon names and showcase those pokemon names in the form of a table. Yes, Just names of those pokemons. store this list of names in local storage as well. ( Hint: /pokemon is your endpoint )
Anytime you refresh the page; You shouldn't be making network request again but rather take the names from local storage wherein you have stored this and display it to DOM.​
